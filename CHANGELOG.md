## [0.3.0] -

### Fixed
  - A bug introduced when adhering to clippy caused no properties to be parsed. This is fixed.
### Removed
  - The assets folder was accidentally included in the packaging. This is removed now.
  - Own property struct for the various vendors. This was too ambisious as these
    properties are not standard. The openslide standards are kept, and are in line with
    the ones the c api of openslide provides
    (https://openslide.org/api/openslide_8h.html). Vendor specific properties are still
    available in a dictionary.
